# generator-procurify-test

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-procurify-test using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Navigate to the Procurify project directory and install this generator. It should already be included in the package.json:

```bash
npm install
```

Then generate your tests in the Procurify project directory:

```bash
yo procurify-test
```
